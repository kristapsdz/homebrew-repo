This is the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) repository for
[BSD.lv](https://www.bsd.lv) software.  It is kept reasonably up to date
as we release new BSD.lv software.

To use this tap, run:

```sh
brew tap kristapsdz/repo
```

You can then run the usual commands for acquiring the software. For example:

```sh
brew install sblg
brew uninstall sblg
```

The following formulae are available:

- [sblg](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/sblg): simple off-line blog utility
- [lowdown](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown): simple Markdown translator
